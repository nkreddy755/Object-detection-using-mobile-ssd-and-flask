# Object detection using mobile ssd and flask
 
Creating a fine-tuned object detection system using MobileNet SSD and Flask involves several steps, including setting up the environment, training the model, and creating a web application to perform real-time object detection. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. Setting Up Your Environment:

Install Python and necessary packages (TensorFlow, Flask, OpenCV, etc.).
Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

2. Collecting and Preparing Your Dataset:

Gather a dataset of labeled images for object detection.
Annotate the objects in the images with bounding boxes.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Choose a Pretrained MobileNet SSD Model:

Download a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model. You can use models from the TensorFlow Model Zoo or other sources.

4. Fine-Tuning the Model:

Load the pre-trained MobileNet SSD model.
Replace the classification head with a new head that matches the number of classes in your dataset.
Train the model on your dataset.
Save the fine-tuned model.

5. Creating a Flask Web Application:

Set up a Flask project structure with routes, templates, and static files.
Create an HTML form for uploading images.
Implement a Flask route to handle image uploads and perform object detection.

6. Object Detection with MobileNet SSD:

Use OpenCV to preprocess the uploaded image.
Pass the preprocessed image through your fine-tuned MobileNet SSD model.
Post-process the model's output to extract bounding box coordinates and class labels.
Draw bounding boxes and labels on the image.

7. Displaying the Results:

Display the annotated image to the user.
Optionally, provide a download link for the processed image.

8. Run the Flask Application:

Start the Flask development server.
Access the application through a web browser.
